			Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. This season is usually associated with warm or hot weather. Typically, schools and universities have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days.During summer, we normally wear light coloured cotton clothes. We sweat a lot in summers. Cotton is a good absorber of water.

	<section>
	You can wear your hair in a braid, ponytail, or bun throughout summer, and the summer outfit that you choose will determine which of three hairstyles you have to wear. (Since my hair is on the longer side itâ€™s usually too hot to wear it down.)

	Lots of dangling necklaces or bangles can stick to your skin in the heat. Choose one statement accessory, like hoop earrings or a neckpiece
